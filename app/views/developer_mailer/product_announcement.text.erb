Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

Duncan here, founder of Waivolt, with an exciting product announcement.

Solar professionals can now add up to 5 specialties to their profile. Specialties are a new way to share what you are passionate about with hiring businesses.

You don't need to be an expert (yet!). Specialties let businesses know what you do best - what sets you apart from other solar professionals.

Soon businesses will be able to filter profiles by these tags. And solar professionals with specialties will appear at the top of search results.

So make sure to add your specialties as soon as possible:
