<p>Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,</p>
<p>Duncan here, founder of <%= link_to "Waivolt", root_url %>, with an exciting product announcement.</p>
<p>Electricians can now add up to 5 <i>specialties</i> to their profile. Specialties are a new way to <b>share what you are passionate about with hiring businesses</b>.</p>
<p>You don't need to be an expert (yet!). Specialties let businesses know what you do best - what sets you apart from other electricians.</p>
<p>Soon businesses will be able to filter profiles by these tags. And electricians with specialties will appear at the top of search results.</p>
<p>So make sure to add <%= link_to "your specialties", notification_url(@notification.record) %> as soon as possible!</p>
<p>If you need help tweaking your profile or specialties let me know by hitting reply.</p>
