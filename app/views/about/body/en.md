### Empowering energy professionals

I've been working in training for the building trades since 2007. With my first company, HeatSpring, I built an online training platform responsible for training tens of thousands of energy professionals on clean energy techologies like solar PV. In 2023 I created Waivolt, an Oregon benefit company, to help energy professionals find work.

Now more than ever, the world is in need of energy professionals. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has paved the way for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to electrify everything. Millions of electricans will be required to do the job, are you up for it?

*Master Electrician?* That's the most in demand and hardest to place position in the market.
*Journeyman Electrician?* Take your career to the next level.
*Apprentice Electrician?* There has never been a better time to grow.
*No experience?* You might be more in demand that you think, it takes hard work and a willingness to learn.

### Doing everything in public

Waivolt is an Open Startup *and* open source. It operates fully transparent and shares its metrics, like revenue and expenses. We are an Oregon benefit company and operate on a tripple bottom line accounting system. We will never take money from investors and if we ever go out of business our operations can be carried on by our users.

On top of that, I'm making all my decisions in public and posting questions and ideas when I'm looking for feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/openshiro/waivolt/).
