### Championing all AI/ML developers and their work

The site is open to all AI/ML developers, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, disability, or skill level that follow the [code of conduct](/conduct).

I've been working in renewable energy training for the building trades since 2006. With my first company, HeatSpring, I built a platform and developed training for tens of thousands of solar PV professionals and solar companies. In 2023 I created BotDevs, an Oregon benefit company, to help AI/ML developers find work and get better jobs.

Now more than ever, the world is in need of AI/ML developers. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has paved the way for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in solar. Millions of professionals will be required to do the job, are you up for it?

We operate with full transparency and share our key metrics like revenue and expenses. We are an Oregon benefit company and operate on a tripple bottom line accounting system of people, planet and profit. We will never take money from investors and if we ever go out of business our operations can be carried on by our users.

### Working to help to solve the climate crisis

Passion is critical in a good life and good work. It's increadibly rewarding to work for something positive. The challenge can be scary and sometimes overwhelming but knowing we are working together and supporting each other gives us strength. There is amazing work being done every day and we want to be part of it.
