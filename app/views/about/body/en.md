### Empowering electricians

I've been working in training for the building trades since 2007. As founder and former president of [HeatSpring](https://heatspring.com), I built an online training platform responsible for training tens of thousands of electricians. In 2023 I created Waivolt, an Oregon benefit company, to help companies hire electricians.

Now more than ever, the world is in need of electricians. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has paved the way for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to electrify everything. Millions of electricans will be required to do the job, are you up for saving the planet?

*Licensed Electrician?* That's the most in demand and hardest to place position in the market.
*Journeyman Electrician?* Take your career to the next level.
*Apprentice Electrician?* There has never been a better time to grow.
*No experience?* You might be more in demand that you think, all it takes is passion and a willingness to learn.

### Doing everything in public

Waivolt is an Open Startup *and* open source. It operates fully transparent and shares its metrics, like revenue and traffic. We are an Oregon benefit company and operate on a tripple bottom line accounting system. We will never take money from investors and if we ever go out of business our operations can be carried on by our users.

* [Revenue and expenses](/open)
* [Bug reports](https://app.honeybadger.io/project/EKRGgkQdR0)

On top of that, I'm making all my decisions in public. I'm posting questions and ideas when I'm looking for feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/duncantmiller/waivolt/). And I'm micro blogging about work in progress (and sneak previews) [on Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@duncantmiller).

### Creating a safe, inclusive environment

The site is open to all electricians, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, disability, or skill level that follow the [code of conduct](/conduct).

If something doesn't feel right, or you ever feel uncomfortable, please [send me an email](mailto:duncan@waivolt.com) right away.
