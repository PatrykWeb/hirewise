### Empowering solar professionals

I've been working in renewable energy training for the building trades since 2006. With my first company, HeatSpring, I built an online training platform responsible for training tens of thousands of professionals on clean solar techologies like solar PV. In 2023 I created Waivolt, an Oregon benefit company, to help solar professionals find work and get better jobs.

Now more than ever, the world is in need of solar professionals. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has paved the way for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in solar. Millions of professionals will be required to do the job, are you up for it?

*Licensed Electrician?* That's the most in demand and hardest to place position in the market.
*NABCEP Certified?* Take your career to the next level.
*No experience?* You might be more in demand that you think, it takes hard work and a willingness to learn.

### Doing everything in public

Waivolt is an Open Startup *and* open source. It operates fully transparent and shares its metrics, like revenue and expenses. We are an Oregon benefit company and operate on a tripple bottom line accounting system. We will never take money from investors and if we ever go out of business our operations can be carried on by our users.

On top of that, I'm making all my decisions in public and posting questions and ideas when I'm looking for feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/openshiro/waivolt/).

### Creating a safe, inclusive environment

The site is open to all solar professionals, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, disability, or skill level that follow the [code of conduct](/conduct).
