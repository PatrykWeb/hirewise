Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Duncan Miller. I'm building Waivolt to make it easier for energy professionals to find their next job.

Waivolt is a reverse job board for energy professionals where you can create a free profile that features your experience, skills and location. Hiring companies can then search the profiles and contact you through the platform about jobs.

Waivolt is being built around three core values:

1. Empowering energy professionals
1. Doing everything in public
1. Creating a safe, inclusive environment
