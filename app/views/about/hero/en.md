I'm Duncan Miller, I help AI/ML developers find jobs and I help leading solar companies fill open positions and grow faster.

BotDevs is a reverse job board for the solar industry. AI/ML developers can create a free profile that features their experience, skills and location. Hiring companies can then search the profiles and contact professionals through the platform about jobs.

Our core values:

- Championing **all** AI/ML developers and their work
- Operating with trust, integrity and open transparency
- Working to help to solve the climate crisis
